# OOIP for Controls and Automation Engineers
Welcome to the Object-Oriented Industrial Programming (OOIP) examples and documentation.
This project uses the CODESYS IDE to demonstrate the application of object-oriented programming principles in industrial automation projects.
While this resource is based on CODESYS, it is not officially affiliated with the CODESYS Group.

It is designed to help control engineers and automation developers apply modern programming practices — such as encapsulation, modularity, and design patterns — using the IEC 61131-3 standard in CODESYS.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- ✅ Provide practical, real-world examples of OOIP principles using CODESYS
- ✅ Teach design patterns like Singleton and Command in an industrial context
- ✅ Share best practices and reusability tips for scalable PLC projects
- ✅ Create a structured and open knowledge base for eduactional and reference purposes

---

## 🧠 Who This Is For

- Controls engineers transitioning to Structured Text and OO programming
- Software developers collaborating with PLC/ Controls teams
- Teams aiming to modernise architectures in a clean and maintainable way

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

A basic level of programming and automation knowledge is assumed. 

Examples are built using Codesys v3.5 SP20 Patch 1 so it is recommended that you install this version (or later) in order to follow along with these examples.
