# OOIP for Controls and Automation Engineers
Welcome to **Object-Oriented Industrial Programming (OOIP)** examples and docs.

This repository was created to store and make available all of the PLC programming examples posted via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-lawson/) account. 
It demonstrates how to apply OOP principles and design patterns in CODESYS using IEC 61131-3 languages (primarily structured text).

*Note: This project has no official affiliation with the CODESYS Group — just a practical guide offering an alternative approach to controls software development.*

## Project Goals

✅ Provide practical examples of OOIP principles using CODESYS

✅ Demonstrate sclable design patterns for industrial controls projects

✅ Share best practices and reusability tips for PLC projects

✅ Create a structured and open knowledge base for eduactional and reference purposes

---

## Who This Is For

- Controls engineers transitioning to Structured Text and OO programming
- Software developers collaborating with PLC/ Controls teams
- Teams aiming to modernise architectures in a clean and maintainable way

---

## Prerequisites

A basic level of programming and automation knowledge is assumed. 

Examples are built using Codesys v3.5 SP20 Patch 1 so it is recommended that you install this version (or later) in order to follow along with these examples.

The Codesys IDE is available for free at the [Codesys Store](https://store.codesys.com/en/).

## How to Use This Site

Start with the [Features](docs/features/FunctionBlocks.md) section to learn about individual OO features, then explore [Patterns](docs/patterns/Command.md) to see how you can start putting them together!

---

## Using an example project

All examples are exported in PLCopenXML format.

To import one of the examples:

--> Create a new **blank** project in CODESYS

--> Highlight the very top level in the device tree (project name)

--> Go to the Project drop-down menu

--> Select Import **PLCopenXML...**

![Insert POU](site/private/images/Index/Import XML.png){ width=400 }

## Want to contribute?

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to get in touch and discuss how you can contribute your own examples or suggest inprovements to the project.

I have created an examples section where people can share ther projects/ libraries with the controls/automation community. If you have something to add just let me know!
