# 🧱 Methods

🔍 What are Methods?
In CODESYS, methods are reusable, encapsulated pieces of logic that belong to a Function Block or a Class. They're like functions, but scoped to a specific object instance — letting you operate on that FB’s internal state.

This is a big step towards writing modular, readable code.
